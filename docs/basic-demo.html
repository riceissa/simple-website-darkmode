  <h1>Simple Website Darkmode – demo page</h1>

  <p>The rest of this page (after the image gallery) is just junk to make the page load slower, so that
  you can see there is no weird flicker when the page loads. In bad
  implementations of darkmode, the darkmode script doesn’t run until the whole
  page loads, so while the page is loading the default color scheme (usually
  light) is used, and then a moment later the dark theme is loaded (this is
  assuming the user prefers dark; if the user prefers light, then there is no
  theme switching so no flicker either). For the user, this means getting
  blinded for a moment by a wall of white, and then going back to the expected
  dark screen. The implementation here doesn’t have this disadvantage: the
  script runs as soon as the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag opens, but before
  the rest of the content loads, so the screen is dark from the start.</p>
